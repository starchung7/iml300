            One thing that stood out to me from the first article was that I never realized how “primitive” early computer art started. It was really interesting reading how computer art started from a pen attached to a drawing machine and grew to incorporate more detail as technology advanced. The work that stood out the most to me was Pixillation, by Lillian Schwartz. I thought that this was interesting as it was one of the first artworks to be created using a computer language. For the second article, the artist that stood out to me the most was Ben Laposky. I thought that his oscillographic art was very intriguing as it took sound waves and represented them visually. It is a merging of two different mediums and it very interesting how every sound has its own unique visual representation.

        <div class="text-a">
            With the rise of the metaverse, do you think art will become more interactive and immersive?
            Due to the fact that our world is highly reliant on digital technologies, do you think that digital art has become more prominent than traditional art?
            Technology is constantly advancing, and with it digital art is constantly changing as well. Do you think that as more technologies are coming out previous forms of digital art are obsolete?

            I thought that it was very interesting to get a look into the origins of the GUI and how computer technology was able to advance from the command prompt days. It was really cool to see how the GUI was able to change the game by combining all interfaces into a single screen as well as having icons that were clickable instead of having to type out everything. From this sprouted things such as the What You See is What You Get Interface, which introduced things such as folders, and the trash can. Another thing that caught me off guard and that I didn’t even think about was the GUI’s ties to racism. I thought the fact that the computer changed from the black screen to the white screen was very interesting as it is a metaphor for erasing blackness.

            - Would the creation of the GUI be any different if it wasn’t entirely made by white men?
            Why exactly was the computer screen changed being entirely back to white?
            What can we do in the future to make sure everyone is equal as computer technology advances?

            I thought that it was so interesting to learn about the history of the internet. One thing that I never knew before was that the creation of the internet was actually pioneered by women, however, men slowly began to overtake the industry and tried to discourage women to continue.
            One thing I thought was cool was seeing the visual representation of the internet. There are many small websites scattered around, but it seems like corporations like google and facebook have dominated the space. Learning about how the internet functions also peaked my interest. I never knew before that that all websites require both a host and a domain.

            I thought that Lauren McCarthy’s presentation was very interesting as she brought to light many things about our digital privacy that I haven't thought about before. I thought that her Lauren project was extremely interesting as it brings to light how creepy a smart home is. Once you swap out the AI for a real human it made me realize how much of an invasion of privacy a smart home device really is. I also thought it was interesting to see that the Amazon Alexa has been found to do 100 recordings a day even when it is not triggered. This gave me a completely different perspective on smart home technology, and now I am much more hesitant to adopt this technology.

            This week's reading brought me new knowledge into the world of poor images in ways that I have never really explored before. One thing that stood out to me was the fact that value can be looked at in two ways, both from resolution and exchange value, and in velocity, intensity, and spread. With viewing poor images through this lens, it has allowed me to realize that poor images do play an important role in society as they are able to send a message across very quickly. In their own way, poor images have their own value that goes beyond aesthetics or artistry. They are able to gain a sense of popularity within the public in ways that high quality images cannot.

            Is it more profitable to be making poor images in today’s society?

            TED Talk:
        </div>
        <div class="text-a">
            Algorithmic bias is a topic that I have heard about previously, however, it is something that I have not really delved into before. This TED talk explains how algorithmic bias is present due to the fact that many training programs used to help differentiate people do not use a very diverse set of people. Due to this people who deviate from what the algorithm was given are not detected as humans. This technology has sparked controversy all across the world as it is unfair that there is this much racial discrimination within our technology. I agree with the TED talk in the sense that we need to start giving more diverse face sets to AIs in order to get rid of this algorithmic bias. Without this, we likely will not see a change in how see us as humans and there will continue to be discrimination in our technologies.

            TED Talk:
        </div>
        <div class="text-a">
            This week's Ted Talk is one that I am familiar with. In this talk, we learn about Adichie’s life growing up and how the single story had affected her life. The single story is when you have a very one-sided view of one’s culture. A good example of this is when Adichie’s friend asks for music she listened to back in Nigeria. Her friend believed that Adichie would listen to tribal music as she had a single story view of Nigeria. When she found out that they both listened to similar music, she was shocked. I think that the single story is something that is present all around us. Many people have a very one-sided view of other cultures, and this is something that I believe we should work on changing. However, this is not necessarily their fault, a lot of these single stories come from negative stereotypes that have been ingrained into us at a young age. I think that if we want things to change, we need to find a way to better represent/understand other cultures within ours.

            In watching this video, I thought that the museum 365 project was the most interesting. I just thought that it was unique how Ari Melenciano created a space where African American artists could come to create art that is separate from activism. In this space, rather than creating pieces for the purpose of activism, people are able to make art beyond things like social identity and just enjoy creating. This was very interesting to me because a lot of art in this world has deeper meaning and ties to social activism, and with this museum, creators are able to put all of that away and instead just create in a carefree place. I also enjoyed how she touched upon how capitalism is wasteful and how we should change our economy to a circular design. She brings up Apple as an example of how Apple encourages people to buy a new phone every year and just get rid of their old one.

        <div class="text-a">
            Of all of the pieces in this exhibition, the one that stood out to me the most was the Forest of Things by Manuel Tozzi. I really enjoyed this one as it was able to immerse me in this eerie forest, and I think it did a great job of creating its atmosphere. Everything from the music and sounds of water droplets to the fog and creepy X shaped monsters walking around, was placed in a way that resulted in a haunting atmosphere.
