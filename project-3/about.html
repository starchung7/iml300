        This website is a project about Asian misrepresentation within film. As more and more films are being made and diversity is becoming more integrated within these films, it is important that we acknowledge and recognise what proper representation looks like. Over the years, Asian characters have been limited to stereotypes and comic relief, rather than being fully fledged characters. While representation has been slowly getting better over the years, it is still not at the level that it needs to be. This website will showcase both bad and good examples of Asian representation within film in hopes that filmmakers can recognize how Asians should be represented in this form of media. Through this, the hope is that filmmakers can see past mistakes in representation, and apply this knowledge to their films to make sure that this misrepresentation can no longer be an issue.
