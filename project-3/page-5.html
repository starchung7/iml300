        There are still some films out there that do a great job of representing Asian characters. Here are a couple examples of how Asians should be represented in film.
    </div>
    <div class="text-i">
        Minari - Free of stereotypes, Minari perfectly portrays the story of Korean immigrants moving to America in search of the American dream. By showcasing the normal life of asain immigrants, the film makes their story more relatable, showing the audience that everyone, regardless of race, goes through similar struggles.
    </div>
    <div class="text-j">
        Everything, Everywhere, All At Once - Everything, Everywhere, All at Once goes beyond the norm for an Asain film and it shows that Asian characters can be much more than the stereotypical nerd. This film showcases characters from multiple generations and the clash of ideals between each generation. It not only shows properly represents the family dynamic of an Asian household, but it also includes proper LGBTQ representation.
    </div>
    <div class="text-k">
        Crazy Rich Asians - Crazy Rich Asians was the first of its kind in Hollywood to feature an all Asian cast and lead in over 25 years. It’s success showed that love stories centered among a variety of Asian character types can be box office hits. Characters were beyond the stereotypical “quiet, nerdy Asians” that Hollywood was accustomed to. The Asian lead male was represented as attractive and confident, compared to the past days of Asian men being portrayed as undesirable and lacking. The film also helped movie goers to see stories through an ethnic Asian cultural context.
