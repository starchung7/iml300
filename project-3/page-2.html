        Of the 1,300 top rated movies from 2007-2019, only 29 films featured an Asian lead or co-lead role. This means that over 97% of these films are without Asian representation in lead roles. In Hollywood and popular film, Asians have rarely gotten the opportunity to have the spotlight. Even looking at Asian characters as a whole rather than just lead roles, only 5.9% of characters in these films are played by someone of Asian descent.
