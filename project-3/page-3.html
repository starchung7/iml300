        Long Duk Dong - Played by Gedde Watanabe in the film “Sixteen Candles,” Dong appears in the film solely for comic relief. His American host family calls him the “Chinaman,” and his asian descent is caricatured and used for jokes. He falls into the stereotype of the classic asian nerd with his social awkwardness and sexual ineptitude being the core trait of who he is.

        Even with the little representation that Asians have, many of them are not serious characters and serve nothing to further the plot. Most of the time in Hollywood, Asians are used purely for comic relief.

        I. Y. Yunioshi - Yunioshi in “Breakfast at Tiffany’s” may arguably be the worst portrayal of an Asian within cinema. Played by Mickey Rooney, the character sports big glasses, buck teeth, and a horrible asian accent. Mr. Yunioshi has no real influence on the story’s plot and again falls into the trope of being the comic relief of the film.
