        How Can We Continue to Have Better Representation?
    </div>
    <div class="text-b3">
        * Write Asian characters that defy stereotypes even if those stereotypes are "good". Asians are much more than thier stereotypes, and this should be apparent within thier characters as well. *
    </div>
    <div class="text-b4">
        * Portray more proper Asian diversity. There are many groups that are part of the Asian community that are rich with culture that have never gotten accurate exposure. *
    </div>
    <div class="text-b5">
        * Hire more Asians behind the camera. This includes directors, producers, writers, etc. Authentic stories come from people who can speak from experience and incorporate nuances to the characters and settings within the film. *
    </div>
    <div class="text-b6">
        * Avoid labeling media created by and featuring an Asian cast as solely "Asian films." While this is technically correct, keep in mind that Asians are just like everyone else, and that they should not be limited to just the fact that they are Asian. *
